I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and collaboration. In my free time I enjoy learning about historical programming languages (Assembly, LISP, Prolog, COBOL, etc) and working on interesting projects. 
I love to read, especially non-fiction math and science.

My New Year's resolution is to be more active in side projects after work, so here I am. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to work on stuff together or need code reviews. We can hash something out on a saturday :) 

Some of my professional interests include:
Supercomputing, Quantum Computing, Systems Engineering, Cloud Computing, Computational Research, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, System Design, API Development, and Mentoring.
