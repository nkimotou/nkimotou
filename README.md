### Hello! I'm Nanami!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a background in cloud computing, supercomputing, software and system architecture, automation.
I have a B.S. in Computer Science and will begin working part-time on my M.S. in Computer Science towards the end of 2023. I'll be focusing on Algorithm Design and Super Computing, Machine Learning, and Embedded Systems. 
I'd like to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science or a related field in the far future and participate in computational research.

I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and I like to work on personal projects in my free time. I also like to read, especially books about math and science.
