### Hello! I'm Nanami!👋

I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and cross-functional collaboration. In my free time I enjoy learning about retired programming languages (Assembly, LISP, Prolog, COBOL, etc), computer chip development, and quantum computing. 
I love to read, especially non-fiction math and science.

Some of my professional interests include:
Supercomputing, Quantum Computing, Systems Engineering, Cloud Computing, Computational Research, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, System Design, API Development, and Mentoring.
