### Hello! I'm Nanami!👋

I'm a Staff Software Engineer specializing in Core Infrastructure, Supercomputing, Low-Level, and Legacy systems. 

I get a lot of joy from working on ambiguous problems and mapping out creative, easily maintainable, and feasible solutions. 

I'm a strong advocate for open-source development, continuous learning, and collaboration. In my free time I love learning new things, reading, and solving puzzles.
