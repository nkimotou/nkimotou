### Hello! I'm Nanami!ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Staff Software Engineer specializing in Supercomputing, Back-end Infrastructure, and Systems Programming. 

I'm a strong advocate for open-source development and a big fan of working on legacy code. I'm a life-long continuous learner, performance-optimizer, and rat on a wheel. 

**The type of teams I really thrive in:**

- core infrastructure and services

- high-performance computing

- computational research labs

- systems/kernal
